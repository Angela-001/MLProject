Using Machine Learning to Predict Temperature Trends in South Carolina Using Historical Climate Data

Predicting temperature trends is crucial for a large number of sectors, including agricultural planning, ecological studies, and climate adaptation strategies. This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict temperature trends in South Carolina for 2024 using climate data from 2015 to 2023. The model is trained on a dataset of approximately 21,000 weather records from weather stations across South Carolina from NOAA’s NCEI (National Centers for Environmental Information) website. This study examines nonlinear temperature patterns, accounting for significant monthly and seasonal variability to better understand climate fluctuations.  

Feature engineering involves extracting the month from the date column to analyze monthly trends and adding a year column to assess the impact of climate change on temperature patterns. Additionally, the data is aggregated seasonally to compare the accuracy of the seasonal and monthly predictions. This project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook, using Pandas and NumPy for data processing. The Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used for visualization, and Scikit-learn is used to implement machine learning models such as linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. By incorporating a wide range of supervised machine learning regression-based techniques, this approach provides insights into South Carolina’s temperature trends for the year 2024 and the effectiveness of machine learning models in nonlinear climate prediction. Ultimately, this research enhances the understanding of regional climate dynamics and provides a robust framework for building resilience to future climatic shifts in South Carolina.
