# MLProject
Predicting temperature trends is crucial for many sectors, including agricultural planning and climate adaptation. This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict temperature trends in South Carolina for 2024 using climate data from 2000 to 2023. The models were trained on a dataset of approximately 97,000 records from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather stations across South Carolina. 
Feature engineering involved extracting temporal features and computing rolling averages to capture seasonal patterns. The analysis was conducted in Python using Pandas for data processing, Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for modeling. The models implemented were Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regression. Results indicated that while XGBoost marginally outperformed others, overall predictive power was moderate. This highlighted challenges in predicting temperature with limited variables and highly correlated features. Ultimately, this research enhances the understanding of regional climate dynamics and provides a robust framework for building resilience to future climatic shifts in South Carolina.
